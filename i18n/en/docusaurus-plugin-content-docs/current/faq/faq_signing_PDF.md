## &#x1F180; What should I do if I am unable to electrically sign the pledge because I am using a mailer that can only receive text format?

&#x1F150; "Acrobat Sign signature request emails are sent in HTML format, so you should be set up to be able to receive them.

If you can only receive it in text format and can copy the link on the [Confirm and Sign] button, please copy and paste the URL to your browser and sign the pledge."
