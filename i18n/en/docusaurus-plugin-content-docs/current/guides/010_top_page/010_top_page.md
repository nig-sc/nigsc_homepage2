## Announcement of New System Launch

### Important Notes on Migration from the Previous Supercomputer  

The following is a reiteration of the information previously provided via email and on the website.  

#### (1) Home Directory Migration  
The final state of user home directories as of February 14, 2025, 5:00 PM has been copied to the new supercomputer’s storage.  

#### (2) Changes to Billing for Charged Services  
The billing rates for storage, memory-optimized nodes, and accelerator-optimized nodes (GPU nodes) have been revised to reflect the proportional leasing costs, in consideration of business continuity.  
For details on the updated pricing, please refer to the [Supercomputer (2025) Terms of Use](/application/terms_and_policies/terms_of_use_2025/) page.

:::warning
Due to limited disk capacity, the research institute does not back up data in users' home directories. Users are responsible for backing up their data.

## Year-End Account Renewal Applications {#year-end-renewals}

The account application system is currently being revised for security enhancements, which is causing a delay in its reopening. Account renewal applications will be processed after the system is reopened. For 2024FY, account renewal for the supercomputer(2025) will be handled by the supercomputer administrator without use's application.


## Regular Maintenance in Fiscal Year 2025 {#2025-annual-maintenance}

The regular maintenance for fiscal year 2025 is scheduled around November 2025.


## Temporary Suspension of New Account Registrations for Large-Scale Users in General and Personal Genome Analysis Areas (May 13, 2022) {#registration-suspension}

Thank you for using the NIG supercomputer.

Due to the supercomputer's computational resources being highly constrained in terms of both CPU and disk, new account registrations for the following users will be temporarily suspended:

- Large-scale users in the general analysis area
- Users in the personal genome analysis area

The following applications will continue to be accepted:

- Additional resource usage requests for users who are already large-scale users in the general analysis area or personal genome analysis area.
- Regular user registrations for the general analysis area. In this case, disk usage is limited to an initial setting of up to 1TB.
- Applications for workshop usage will also continue to be accepted.

However, we ask for your understanding as it may not always be possible to meet your requests.

The resumption of new account registrations will be decided based on the availability of computational resources. Updates on the availability will be published on the homepage every four months. Prospective users are requested to refer to these updates and submit their usage plans in advance. Please note that the availability forecasts are not guaranteed, and requests may not always be fulfilled.
