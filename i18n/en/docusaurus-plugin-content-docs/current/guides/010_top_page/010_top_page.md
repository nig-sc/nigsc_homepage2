:::info Notice of Power Outage Due to Lightning Strike: Resumption of Supercomputer Service

[Due to the power outage caused by lightning around 13:40 on Friday, September 5, 2025, the NIG supercomputer had been out of service.](/blog/2025-09-08-blackout)  However, the login service was resumed at 12:00 on Tuesday, September 9, 2025. (For dedicated VMs that had not been confirmed to be running as of 12:00 on September 9, all of them were successfully restarted by 15:00 on Wednesday, September 10.)

- **[On 6th November 2025, restoration works were conducted on the power supply infrastructure at the National Institute of Genetics, which had been disrupted by a lightning strike. Due to the repair work being close to the weekend, the NIG Supercomputer was scheduled to be offline from 08:30 on Thursday, 6 November 2025, until 09:00 on Monday, 10 November 2025. However, the work proceeded smoothly, and the NIG Supercomputer was restored earlier than planned, by 17:30 on Friday, 7 November 2025.](/blog/2025-11-06-power-outage)**

## Year-End Account Renewal Applications {#year-end-renewals}

The account application system is currently being revised for security enhancements, which is causing a delay in its reopening. Account renewal applications will be processed after the system is reopened. For 2024FY, account renewal for the supercomputer(2025) will be handled by the supercomputer administrator without use's application.


## Regular Maintenance in Fiscal Year 2025 {#2025-annual-maintenance}

The Regular maintenance for the 2025 financial year will be carried out from Friday, 13 March 2026 to Thursday, 19 March 2026.

For further details, please refer to the information below.

## Temporary Suspension of New Account Registrations for Large-Scale Users in General and Personal Genome Analysis Areas (May 13, 2022) {#registration-suspension}

Thank you for using the NIG supercomputer.

Due to the supercomputer's computational resources being highly constrained in terms of both CPU and disk, new account registrations for the following users will be temporarily suspended:

- Large-scale users in the general analysis area
- Users in the personal genome analysis area

The following applications will continue to be accepted:

- Additional resource usage requests for users who are already large-scale users in the general analysis area or personal genome analysis area.
- Regular user registrations for the general analysis area. In this case, disk usage is limited to an initial setting of up to 1TB.
- Applications for workshop usage will also continue to be accepted.

However, we ask for your understanding as it may not always be possible to meet your requests.

The resumption of new account registrations will be decided based on the availability of computational resources. Updates on the availability will be published on the homepage every four months. Prospective users are requested to refer to these updates and submit their usage plans in advance. Please note that the availability forecasts are not guaranteed, and requests may not always be fulfilled.
