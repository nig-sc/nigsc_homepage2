## Target users of the NIG supercomputer

As a member of the Inter-University Research Institute Corporation, National Institute of Genetics operates a supercomputer system for the purpose of providing resources for life science research and education focusing on genetics.

As a general rule, users can use the NIG supercomputer for free. But from the viewpoint of business continuity and promotion of efficient use of computational resources, we provides billing services for storage of especially large-scale data and using additional services.

On the other hand, the supercomputer system is subject to Export Administration Regulations under the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act (FEFTA), and are subject to punishment if used for weapons manufacturing purposes. In the context of these circumstances, in the NIG supercomputer, we issue login user accounts for the following people.

1. A domestic resident as prescribed in FEFTA, and  a faculty member of a university or a public research institute
2. A collaborative researcher of 1. or a researcher, a student, a researcher of contractors, etc. under the guidance of 1. (including international students, overseas job transfer, overseas researchers)

In principle, the purpose of use and results are open to the public. However, if you want to postpone the release date, contact us.
