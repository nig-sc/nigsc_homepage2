On 8 February 2023, the Github Discussions website has been set up as a place to discuss questions and answers to the NIG supercomputer.

&#x1f517;<u>https://github.com/nig-sc/nigsc_homepage2/discussions</u>

- To ask and answer questions, create your github account.
- If you know of a solution to a question, not only for the supercomputer team, it would be helpful if you could write an answer.
- We may also ask for your help with questions sent to sc-helpdesk when we think it will help other users.
- We would be grateful for your cooperation, as it will help users who face similar problems in the future.

We are also looking for users to add articles to the supercomputer website.

When you send a pull request to the github repository, we will respond.
