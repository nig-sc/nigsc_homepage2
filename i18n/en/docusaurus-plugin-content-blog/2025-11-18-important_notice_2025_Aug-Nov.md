## 1. Notice Regarding the NIG Supercomputer Outage and Recovery Following the Lightning Strike on Friday, 5 September 2025

At approximately 13:40 on Friday, 5 September 2025, the National Institute of Genetics (NIG) was struck by a lightning bolt, causing significant damage to the facility’s electrical infrastructure and resulting in a power outage.

As a consequence, the NIG Supercomputer was temporarily rendered unavailable. However, the login service was restored promptly at 12:00 on Tuesday, 9 September 2025. (For those dedicated virtual machines that had not been confirmed to be operational by 12:00 on 9 September, all were successfully restarted by 15:00 on Wednesday, 10 September.)

Repairs to the damaged equipment were completed on Thursday, 6 November 2025. Due to the repair work being close to the weekend, the NIG Supercomputer was scheduled to be offline from 08:30 on Thursday, 6 November 2025, until 09:00 on Monday, 10 November 2025. However, the work proceeded smoothly, and the NIG Supercomputer was restored earlier than planned, by 17:30 on Friday, 7 November 2025.

Please note that the high-voltage generator, which also sustained damage from the lightning strike, will require additional repairs. These repairs are scheduled to take place during the statutory power outage on Saturday, 14 March 2026, at which time the entire NIG facility will again be taken offline.
