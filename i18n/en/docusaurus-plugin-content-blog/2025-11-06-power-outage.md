At approximately 13:40 on Friday, 5 September 2025, the National Institute of Genetics (NIG) was struck by a lightning bolt, causing significant damage to the facility’s electrical infrastructure and resulting in a power outage.

As a consequence, the NIG Supercomputer was temporarily rendered unavailable. However, the login service was restored promptly at 12:00 on Tuesday, 9 September 2025. (For those dedicated virtual machines that had not been confirmed to be operational by 12:00 on 9 September, all were successfully restarted by 15:00 on Wednesday, 10 September.)

Repairs to the damaged equipment were completed on Thursday, 6 November 2025. Due to the repair work being close to the weekend, the NIG Supercomputer was scheduled to be offline from 08:30 on Thursday, 6 November 2025, until 09:00 on Monday, 10 November 2025. However, the work proceeded smoothly, and the NIG Supercomputer was restored earlier than planned, by 17:30 on Friday, 7 November 2025.
