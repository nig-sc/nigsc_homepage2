## Summary


To change the correspondence between OSS and OST in the Lustre6 failure recovery work,
1/3 of the area in /lustre6 will be temporarily inaccessible.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, and thank you for your understanding and cooperation.


## Work Time

Monday, October 04, 2021 10:30 - 10:45

It took longer than expected, but the work was completed around 12:00.

## Affected area

Access to a part of /lustre6 (about 1/3 of the area) will be disabled.


When accessing a part of the area in /lustre6 during the above time, I/O may become "waiting" in suspend state.
　Note that the running jobs will not be deleted and will be automatically restarted after the recovery.
